Copy the flatiron\_1.70\_x64.dlt file to your 3ds Max plugins folder, which is usually located at C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2013\plugins. Then open the x-force.nfo file with a text editor and follow the instructions to generate a serial number and an activation code for the plugin.

## Step 3: Use 3D IO Flatiron V1.70 For 3DS Max 2013 XFORCE
 
To use the plugin, you need to select the objects or scenes that you want to bake textures and lighting for. Then go to Rendering > Tools > Flatiron Render To Texture. A dialog box will appear where you can adjust various settings for the baking process, such as output size, format, channels, quality, etc.
 
After setting up your preferences, click on Start Baking and wait for the plugin to do its magic. You will see a progress bar and a preview window showing the results of the baking. When the baking is done, you will find your baked textures in the output folder that you specified.
 
You can then apply these textures to your objects or scenes using any material editor or shader that supports them. You can also export them to other applications or platforms that require baked textures and lighting.
